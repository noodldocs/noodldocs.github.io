# Date Picker Button

This module contains a single code node the [Date Picker Button](/modules/datepicker-button/datepicker-button.md) node that can be used to launch a date picker on desktop and on mobile (the native picker).

## Adding the module to your project

Since the **Date Picker Button** node is not part of the default node set in Noodl, we need to add the Date Picker Button module. Open the Noodl project in which you want to add the module, and import it from the sidebar.

<div class="ndl-images">
    <img src="/modules/datepicker-button/datepicker-add-module.png" class="ndl-image med"></img>
</div>

Once that's done you'll be able to create the **Date Picker Button** node.
