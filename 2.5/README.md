# Happy to see you here!

Noodl is a low code web app builder that will have you creating applications faster and smarter. It's mixing visual development with simple Javascript, but you don't need any previous coding experience to start learning. The main focus is to empower designers and developers working together and provide a workflow that allows for high flexibility, scalability and quick iterations. 

## Getting started

-   If you're **new to node based programming**, it is recommended to at least glance through the [Basic Concepts](/guides/basic-concepts/) page to get an overview of the essentials.

-   If you just want to **get more familiar** with the editor you can watch the [Editor Tour](/guides/editor-tour/), a 15 minute long video taking you through the tool.

-   If you want to **get your hands dirty** straight away we recommend the [Build along videos](/tutorials/getting-started.md), two 15 minute long videos taking you through the process of building out a UI for task list app and connecting it to a cloud database.
