Use the alignment gadget to specify how this node is aligned to its parent. Important to note is that the horizontal alignment options won't have any effect if the parent's layout is set to _Horizontal_, and similarly the vertical alignments have no effect if the parent's layout is set to _Vertical_.

From left to right, the alignment options are:

- _Align Bottom_ - Align this node to the bottom of its parent. Doesn't have any effect if parent's layout is set to _Vertical_.
- _Align Vertical Center_ - Align this node to the vertical center of its parent. Doesn't have any effect if parent's layout is set to _Vertical_.
- _Align Top_ -Align this node to the top of its parent. Doesn't have any effect if parent's layout is set to _Vertical_.
- _Align Left_ - Align this node to the left side of its parent. Doesn't have any effect if parent's layout is set to _Horizontal_.
- _Align Horizontal Center_ Align this node to the horizontal center of its parent. Doesn't have any effect if parent's layout is set to _Horizontal_.
- _Align Right_ - Align this node to the right of its parent. Doesn't have any effect if parent's layout is set to _Horizontal_.
