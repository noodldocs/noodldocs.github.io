# GraphQL Module

This module enables you to use the GraphQL node which makes it quick and easy to connect to services using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

After you add the module to your project you will have access to the **GraphQL Query** node. Find details in the [**GraphQL Query**](/library/modules/graphql/graphql-node) reference docs.
