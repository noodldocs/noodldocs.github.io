We need this to perform edits and deletes. The simplest way to solve this is to issue a new "list all members" request. Simply connect the ',(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Success"),' signal from the "Create new member" REST node to the ',(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Fetch"),' input of the "List all members" REST node.

Now let's move on to editing a member."),(0,o.kt)("h2",{id:"editing-a-member"},"Editing a member"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Editing a member is very similair to creating a new member. We need to use a different method but the same resource. We also need to provide the ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Object Id")," as part of the URI.

So we will use the following resource and method on this ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"REST")," node.
