# QR code scanner

This module is a wrapper of the [QR Scanner](https://github.com/nimiq/qr-scanner#readme) library. I contains two nodes, the [Camera QR Scanner](/modules/qr-scanner/nodes/camera-qr-scanner) and the [Image QR Scanner](/modules/qr-scanner/nodes/image-qr-scanner) nodes. With this module you can build apps that can scan QR codes either using the camera or by uploading an image.
