Documentation coming soon...

## Adding the module to your project

Since the **Lottie** node is not part of the default node set in Noodl, we need to add the Lottie module. Open the Noodl project in which you want to add the module, and import it from the sidebar.

![](/modules/lottie/lottie-add-module.png)

Once that's done you'll be able to create the **Lottie** node.
