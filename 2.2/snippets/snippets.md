# Snippets
Here you will find small and useful guides on how to solve a specific task in Noodl, we call them **Snippets**. 

These snippets can include small Noodl node graphs that you can copy and paste into your project. If you see this button:

![](copy-nodes-button.png ':class=img-size-s')

You can click it to copy the nodes shown on the accompanying image and then paste them into your project in Noodl. If you come across this buttun:

![](import-button.png ':class=img-size-s')

You can click it to import a module and/or components into Noodl. You can either do this into an existing project or create a new project (it's often specific if the import is something you should put in your existing project).

Remember, if you have questions that aren't covered here, you can always join the conversation on [Discord](https://discord.gg/umRupsc2f5).
