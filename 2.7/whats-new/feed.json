The component can be used as is, or tweaked to your needs by opening it up and modifying its internal building blocks.</p><p>You can find all of them under the Prefab tab in the Node Picker:</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Prefab Tab\" src=\"/2.7/assets/images/2022-10-06_1-f3800a43d1218a27c682c466229b6721.png\" width=\"1634\" height=\"1236\" class=\"img_E7b_\"></p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV\" id=\"folder-components\">Folder components<a class=\"hash-link\" href=\"#folder-components\" title=\"Direct link to heading\">​</a></h2><p>In order to make Prefabs easy to work with, Noodl now supports <strong>folder components</strong>.</p><p>A <strong>folder component</strong> is like a regular component, but it can hold other components inside of it. The components inside the <strong>folder component</strong> work just like regular components, but they can only be placed in the <strong>parent component</strong>. They will also never show up in the Node Picker.</p><p>This makes it easier to create things like <strong>lists</strong> or <strong>datepickers</strong>, where you would want to create a <strong>list item</strong> or <strong>day</strong> component to use in repeaters, but that you wouldnt want to use outside of the <strong>list</strong> or <strong>datepicker</strong>.</p><p>Folder component children can be created just like components in folders - by dragging in to, or creating new ones from the parents context menu.</p>",
