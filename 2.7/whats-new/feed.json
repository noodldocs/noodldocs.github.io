You can also find guides helping you to take these prefabs and customize them to suit your own specific needs.</p></section><section><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Prefab Tab\" src=\"/2.7/assets/images/nestedcomponents-918ee790dcfc9166b9733a0d4b6d1911.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"366\" class=\"img_E7b_\"></p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV\" id=\"sub-components\">Sub components<a class=\"hash-link\" href=\"#sub-components\" title=\"Direct link to heading\">​</a></h2><p>To make it easier to organize your project, work with Prefabs, and to create custom components we have enabled the possibility to move components into other components just like folders. This can make components that are dependent on other components to function move self-sustainable. </p><p>Folder component children can be created just like components in folders - by dragging in to, or creating new ones from the parents context menu.</p></section><section><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Prefab Tab\" src=\"/2.7/assets/images/arrayinput-2faf9574f17ada08ef26d72bb4b1207d.png\" width=\"1954\" height=\"1474\" class=\"img_E7b_\"></p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV\" id=\"editable-array-inputs\">Editable array inputs<a class=\"hash-link\" href=\"#editable-array-inputs\" title=\"Direct link to heading\">​</a></h2><p>Nodes with array type inputs can now be edited directly from the property panel. This makes it easier to provide static data. You can provide any javascript which means you can run computations, fetch variables etc.</p></section><section><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Prefab Tab\" src=\"/2.7/assets/images/templates-8ae031c1b2e00160271832b9cb3a018e.png\" width=\"1758\" height=\"1334\" class=\"img_E7b_\"></p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV\" id=\"new-project-templates\">New project templates<a class=\"hash-link\" href=\"#new-project-templates\" title=\"Direct link to heading\">​</a></h2><p>This release comes with update project templates to handle some of the common navigation structures for web apps.
