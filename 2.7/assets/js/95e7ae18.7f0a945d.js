The component can be used as is, or tweaked to your needs by opening it up and modifying its internal building blocks.\\n\\nYou can find all of them under the Prefab tab in the Node Picker.\\n\\n</section>\\n\\n<section>\\n\\n## Folder components\\n\\nIn order to make Prefabs easy to work with, Noodl now supports **folder components**.\\n\\nA **folder component** is like a regular component, but it can hold other components inside of it. The components inside the **folder component** work just like regular components, but they can only be placed in the **parent component**. They will also never show up in the Node Picker.\\n\\nThis makes it easier to create things like **lists** or **datepickers**, where you would want to create a **list item** or **day** component to use in repeaters, but that you wouldnt want to use outside of the **list** or **datepicker**.\\n\\nFolder component children can be created just like components in folders - by dragging in to, or creating new ones from the parents context menu.\\n\\n</section>"},{"id":"september-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/2.7/whats-new/september-2022","source":"@site/whats-new/2022-09-03.md","title":"September update","description":"Platform improvements for September 2022","date":"2022-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 3, 2022","tags":[],"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"September update","description":"Platform improvements for September 2022","slug":"september-2022","hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"October update","permalink":"/2.7/whats-new/october-2022"}},"content":"## Performance improvements\\n\\nThe Noodl Editor has been optimised and sped up, and two notable bugs have been fixed:\\n\\n- Under certain conditions the node graph view would not respond to pan or zoom interactions\\n- Fixed a navigation bug in the Page Router when nesting three or more routers"}]}')}}]);
