You can also find guides helping you to take these prefabs and customize them to suit your own specific needs.\\n</section>\\n\\n<section>\\n\\n\\n![Prefab Tab](./nestedcomponents.png)\\n\\n## Sub components\\n\\nTo make it easier to organize your project, work with Prefabs, and to create custom components we have enabled the possibility to move components into other components just like folders. This can make components that are dependent on other components to function move self-sustainable. \\n\\nFolder component children can be created just like components in folders - by dragging in to, or creating new ones from the parents context menu.\\n\\n</section>\\n\\n<section>\\n\\n![Prefab Tab](./arrayinput.png)\\n\\n## Editable array inputs\\n\\nNodes with array type inputs can now be edited directly from the property panel. This makes it easier to provide static data. You can provide any javascript which means you can run computations, fetch variables etc.\\n\\n</section>\\n\\n<section>\\n\\n![Prefab Tab](./templates.png)\\n\\n## New project templates\\n\\nThis release comes with update project templates to handle some of the common navigation structures for web apps. Previous project templates have been moved to the examples section of the documentation.\\n\\n</section>"},{"id":"september-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/2.7/whats-new/september-2022","source":"@site/whats-new/2022-09-03.md","title":"September update","description":"Platform improvements for September 2022","date":"2022-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 3, 2022","tags":[],"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"September update","description":"Platform improvements for September 2022","slug":"september-2022","hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Noodl 2.7 (Momofuku)","permalink":"/2.7/whats-new/october-2022"}},"content":"## Performance improvements\\n\\nThe Noodl Editor has been optimised and sped up, and two notable bugs have been fixed:\\n\\n- Under certain conditions the node graph view would not respond to pan or zoom interactions\\n- Fixed a navigation bug in the Page Router when nesting three or more routers"}]}')}}]);
