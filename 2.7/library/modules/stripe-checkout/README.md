# Stripe Checkout

This module is built on top of [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout),
which is low-code payment integration that can be customized from their portal.

## Redirect To Stripe Checkout

Redirect your customers to Stripeâ€™s conversion-optimized Checkout,
a Stripe-hosted page to securely collect payment information.
When the customer completes their purchase,
they are redirected back to your website.

:::warning

When the customer is redirected back to the success URL,
we shouldn't assume that the payment is transferred.
Since the customer can just navigate to this website directly.

### Setup

To start using this we first have to enable it inside Stripe.
Here is where you can enable it:

2. Navigate to Settings (gear icon in the top right corner)
