# Cirle

A circle or circle segment.

## INPUTS

### Margin

Using the margin gadget you can specify the top, bottom, left and right margins for this node. You can specify them in either pixels or percentage (of the corrensponding parent dimension).

<div class="ndl-images">
    <img src="/nodes/visual/margin-only.png" class="ndl-image small"></img>  
</div>

**Margin Left**  
The left margin in pixels or % of parent.

**Margin Right**  
The right margin in pixels or % of parent.

**Margin Top**  
The top margin in pixels or % of parent.

**Margin Bottom**  
The bottom margin in pixels or % of parent.

### Alignment

<div class="ndl-images">
    <img src="/nodes/visual/align-props.png" class="ndl-image small"></img>  
</div>

Use the alignment gadget to specify how this node is aligned to its parent. Important to note is that the horizontal alignment options won't have any effect if the parent's layout is set to _Horizontal_, and similarly the vertical alignments have no effect if the parent's layout is set to _Vertical_.

From left to right, the alignment options are:

- _Align Bottom_ - Align this node to the bottom of its parent. Doesn't have any effect if parent's layout is set to _Vertical_.
- _Align Vertical Center_ - Align this node to the vertical center of its parent. Doesn't have any effect if parent's layout is set to _Vertical_.
- _Align Top_ -Align this node to the top of its parent. Doesn't have any effect if parent's layout is set to _Vertical_.
- _Align Left_ - Align this node to the left side of its parent. Doesn't have any effect if parent's layout is set to _Horizontal_.
- _Align Horizontal Center_ Align this node to the horizontal center of its parent. Doesn't have any effect if parent's layout is set to _Horizontal_.
- _Align Right_ - Align this node to the right of its parent. Doesn't have any effect if parent's layout is set to _Horizontal_.

### Other

**Size**  
Specifies the size of the Circle in pixels.

**Start Angle**  
The start angle of the Circle segment.

**End Angle**  
The end angle of the Circle segment.

**Position**  
Controls how this node is layouted in its parent node.

- _In Layout_ - This node is part of the parent node's layout. It will be stacked with its siblings depending on the parent node's layout settings.
- _Absolute_ - This node will not be part of the parent node's layout, instead you are free to use the _Pos X_ and _Pos Y_ to place this node explicitly.

**Pointer Events Mode**  
This specifies how this node will responds to pointer events.

- _Inherit_ - This node will respond to pointer events in the same way as its parent.
- _Explicit_ - This node will respond to pointer events as specified by _Pointer Events Enabled_

**Block Pointer Events**  
This will cause this node to block all pointer events, e.g. any node that is behind this node will not receive pointer events.

**Pointer Events Enabled**  
This property is only available if _Pointer Events Mode_ is set to _Explicit_. It will specify if this node responds to pointer events or not. If set to false this node will completely ignore pointer events.

**Mounted**  
This property is used to completely remove the node from the DOM. If this property is set to false the node is removed from the DOM. It differs from the _Visible_ property where the node is still part of the DOM but invisible.

### Fill

**Fill**  
Specify whether the Cirlce should be filled or not.

**Fill Color**  
Specify the fill color.

### Stroke

**Stroke**  
Enables the stroke of the Circle.

**Stroke Width**  
Sets the width of the Circle stroke.

**Stroke Color**  
Sets the stroke color of the Circle stroke.

**Line Cap**  
Specifies what kind of cap there will be on the circle stroke.

- _Butt_ - A direct cut, not rounded end of the circle stroke.
- _Round_ - A round end to the circle stroke.

### Style

**Opacity**  
The opacity of this node. 0 is completely transparent and invisible. 1 is completely solid and opaque.

**Visible**  
Toggle the visibility of this node on and off.

**zIndex**  
The depth index for this node, this can be any number.

### Placement

**Pos X**  
The X position of this node. Either relative to its parent top left corner or relative to its layouted position depending on the _Position_ property. Can be specified in pixels or as a percentage of its parents width.

**Pos Y**  
The Y position of this node. Either relative to its parent top left corner or relative to its layouted position depending on the _Position_ property. Can be specified in pixels or as a percentage of its parents height.

**Rotation**  
The rotation in degrees.

**Scale**  
Specifies scaling of this node. A value of 0 scales the node down completely so that it is no longer be visible. A value of 1 gives it the original size, and a value of 2 doubles the size and so on.

**Transform Origin X**  
Specifes the X position, within this node, that will be the center for rotation and scale. By default it is the center of the node (i.e. 50%) but you can specify an arbitrary value in either percentage of the node's width or explicitly in pixels.

**Transform Origin Y**  
Specifes the Y position, within this node, that will be the center for rotation and scale. By default it is the center of the node (i.e. 50%) but you can specify an arbitrary value in either percentage of the node's height or explicitly in pixels.

## OUTPUTS

### Other

**Child Index**  
The place this node has in relation to its parent. E.g. if a **Group** has three children, then the first child will have _Child Index_ 0, the second child will have _Child Index_ 1, and so on.

**This**  
A reference to this node. Used in custom **Javascript** nodes and more.

### Bounding Box

**Screen Position X**  
Where this node is on the screen's X-axis, in pixels.

**Screen Position Y**

Current width of this node.

**Height**  
Current height of this node.

### Mounted

**Did Mount**  
Signal sent when this node has been mounted, i.e. has become part of the visual tree and is visible.

**Will Unmount**
