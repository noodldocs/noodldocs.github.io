# Query Collection

This node is used to access a collection of **Models** in the cloud store. To learn more about **Models** and **Collections** check out the [guide](/guides/models-and-collections.md).

## Inputs

### General

**Collection Name**  
The name of the **Collection** that this node will access.

**Use Limit**  
Enables or disables limiting the number of result fetched from the cloud store.

**Limit**  
Specifies the maximum number of **Models** that will be fetched from the cloud store.

**Skip**  
Specifies a number of *Models* that will be skipped when returning the result of the query. This is typically used together with *limit* to achieve pagination.

**Filter**  
The type of filter to choose, can be *Simple* or *Advanced*. See below for more details.

### Filter

By default the **Query Collection** will fetch all **Models**, you can however add a filter. You can choose from a simple filter where you can filter on one or more **Model** properties, or a more advanced JSON based filter syntax. More on that below, first the *simple* filter type.

Add a property that you want to filter on.

For each filter property you can now specify:

**Type**  
The type you want for the filter, can be _Number_, _String_ or _Boolean_.

**Op**  
The available operations of the filter depend on the type that is set.

- _Equals_ Include in filter if the property equals the provided value. Available for all types.
- _Not Equals_ Include in filter if the property does NOT equal the provided value. Available for all types.
- _Greater than_ Include in filter if the property is greater than the provided value. Only available if type is _Number_.
- _Less than_ Include in filter if the property is less than the provided value. Only available if type is _Number_.
- _Greater than or equal_ Include in filter if the property is greater than or equal to the provided value. Only available if type is _Number_.
- _Less than or equal_ Include in filter if the property is less than or equal to the provided value. Only available if type is _Number_.

**Value**  
The value used to test against in the filter operation.

### Sort

By default the **Query Collection** does not return the result of a fetch sorted. You can specify sorting. Like filters you add which properties you want to sort on.

For each property you can choose the sorting order.

## Advanced filters
If you choose *Advanced* as filter type you will get the option to specify a filter script. This is regular javascript code but you need to end the script by calling the *where* function with the filter definition provided. This is done using the following syntax:

```javascript
where({ 
    Completed:{equalTo:true} 
})
```

The above filter will return all models in the collection that has the *Completed* property *true*. You can select from a number of operators:

* **lessThan**	Less Than
* **lessThanOrEqualTo**	Less Than Or Equal To
* **greaterThan**	Greater Than
* **greaterThanOrEqualTo**	Greater Than Or Equal To
* **notEqualtTo**	Not Equal To
* **containedIn**	Contained In
* **notContainedIn**	Not Contained in
* **exists**	A value is set for the key

For instance, to filter on if a certain property (in this example Letter) is one of many possible values:

```javascript
where({ 
    Letter:{containedIn:['A','B','C']} 
})
```

Or to filter all models that have a value set for a specific property:

```javascript
where({ 
    Letter:{exists:true}
})
```

You can also combine these filters into expressions using **and** and **or**, for instance:

```javascript
where({ 
    and: [ 
        {ZipCode:{exists:true}}, 
        {Score:{greaterThan:10}} 
    ]
})
```

You can also use the **matchesRegex** operator to filter by regular expression, this is generally slow and not recommended for large sets. Learn more [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/regex/)

```javascript
where({ 
    SomeString:{matchesRegex:"pattern", options:'i'} 
})
```

As mentioned above the filter script is a javascript function so you can provide javascript code if you like:

```javascript
where({ 
    SomeDate:{equalTo:(new Date()).toISOString()} 
})
```

You can also specify variables instead of explicitly specifying the filter values, this will create an input port on the *Query Collection* node that can then be connected to. You specify variables simply by using the **Inputs** object. The filter below will create an input called MyStringInput.

```javascript
where({ 
    SomeString:{equalTo:Inputs.MyStringInput} 
})
```

You can also do text search in strings. This will create an index in the database and text search only works on one property so you have to choose wisely. Also text search matches whole words and must be the first filter in an *and* or *or* sequence.

```javascript
where({ 
    SomeString:{text:{search:Inputs.MyStringInput}}
})
```

You can also toggle case sensitivity for text searches.

```javascript
where({ 
    SomeString:{text:{search:{
        term:Inputs.MyStringInput,
        caseSensitive:true
    }}}
})
```

If you need to match the *Id* of models in the collection you need to use the special operation:

```javascript
where({ 
    idEqualTo:Inputs.TheModelId
})
```

In the above filter you can connect a *Model Id* output to the *TheModelId* parameter to fetch just one specific object. You can also request a set of object based on their Id.

```javascript
where({ 
    idContainedIn:[Inputs.FirstObjectId, Inputs.SecondObjectId]
})
```

Some properties in your Models can be of *Pointer* type, that means that they reference another object with a specific *Id* and *Collection*. If you want to filter out models that point to a specific model, use this syntax. Let's say you have a collection of *Post* models, each have a set of *Comment* models where each *Comment* points back to it's owning *Post* via the *Owner* property. The filter below will find all *Comments* for a *Post* given that you provide the post id.

```javascript
where({ 
    Owner:{pointsTo: Inputs.MyPostId }
})
```

You can also provide an array if you want to find *Comments* that are related to a set of *Post* models.

```javascript
where({ 
    Owner:{pointsTo: [Inputs.MyFirstPostId, Inputs.MySecondPost] }
})
```

Don't forget that you need to send a signal to *Fetch* to perform a new fetch with a new filter if any of the filter inputs have changed.

Models also support many-to-many relationships via *Relations*, check out the guide [here](/guides/relations.md) for more information. You can filter our all models in the collection you are querying that are related to a specific model via a *Relation* with a given key using:

```javascript
where({ 
    relatedTo:{id: Inputs.MyObjectWithARelation, key: "the-relation-key"}
})
```

### Sorting in advanced filters
To specify the sort order when using advanced filter you run a function called *sort* in the filter script.

```javascript
where({ 
    // You where filter here
})

sort(['createdAt'])
```

The sort function takes an array with strings specifying the names of the properties you want to sort by. You can prefix the property name with "-" to specify that you want to sort in descending order instead of the default ascending order.

```javascript
sort(['-Age','createdAt'])
```

## Outputs

### General

**Name**  
The identifier of this **Collection**. This is the collection name.

**Result**  
An array of the items fetched from the cloud store.

**Count**  
The count of the retuned array from the cloud store.

**First Item Id**  
The *Id* of the first model or *undefined*.

### Events

**Modified**  
Event signal sent when the collection is modified locally, e.g. when a **Model** that has previously been fetched is deleted.

**Fetched**  
Event signal sent when a _Fetch_ is successful.

**Failure**  
Sent when a _Fetch_ has failed.

**Error**  
A string with a message indicating the reason for failure.
