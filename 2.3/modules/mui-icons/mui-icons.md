After you have added the module to your project you will have access to the [Material UI Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline) by placing the **Icon | Material UI** node.

On the properties of this node you can specify which icon to use (you can find the name of the icon using the link above), as well as styling and color.
