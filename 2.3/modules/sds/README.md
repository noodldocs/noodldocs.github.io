# Simple Design System

The simple design system or **SDS** is a collection of user interface component that can help you fast track your application building in Noodl. All components are built in Noodl. When you import the module you will have a new set of components that you can find in the node picker under **Simple Design System**.

If you want to modify the content of each component you will find them in the **Simple Design System** sheet.

In that sheet you can get an overview of all components, you can also modify behaviour, visuals or simply change colors and text styles to make it your own. Use this as a basis for creating your own design system.

Here is a small example project that has an overview of how to use the different components. You can import this project into your Noodl workspace and learn from it.

<div class="ndl-images">
    <img src="/modules/sds/sds-example.png" class="ndl-image small"></img>   
    <button class="ndl-import-button" onClick='importIntoNoodl("modules/sds/sds-example-1-0-0.zip",{name:"SDS Overview",thumb:"modules/sds/sds-example.png"})'></button>
</div>
