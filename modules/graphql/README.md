# GraphQL module

This module enables you to use the GraphQL node which makes it quick and easy to connect to services using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

## Adding the module to your project

Since the **GraphQL Query** node is not part of the default node set in Noodl, we need to add the GraphQL module. Open the Noodl project in which you want to add the module, and import it from the sidebar.

</div>

Once that's done you'll be able to create the **GraphQL Query** node.

After you add the module to your project you will have access to the **GraphQL Query** node. Find details in the [**GraphQL Query**](modules/graphql/graphql-node.md) reference docs.
