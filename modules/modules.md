# Importing Modules
You can import modules into your Noodl project that contain additional functionality. These can be public modules, or private modules that you have added to your workspace. See the [extending](/extending/README) guide for more details on private modules.

To add a module you will first open the **Library panel**, here you can find public modules, private modules and you can also import from your local and cloud projects.

When you want to add a module to your workspace you simply click the **Add** button. Modules may add components to your project, and they can add core nodes. To learn how to use a module make sure you check out the documentation by clicking the **Docs** button.
