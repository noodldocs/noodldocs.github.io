You can also find guides helping you to take these prefabs and customize them to suit your own specific needs.</p></section><section><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Prefab Tab\" src=\"/2.9/assets/images/nestedcomponents-918ee790dcfc9166b9733a0d4b6d1911.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"366\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"sub-components\">Sub components<a href=\"#sub-components\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Sub components\" title=\"Direct link to Sub components\">​</a></h2><p>To make it easier to organize your project, work with Prefabs, and to create custom components we have enabled the possibility to move components into other components just like folders. This can make components that are dependent on other components to function move self-sustainable. </p><p>Folder component children can be created just like components in folders - by dragging in to, or creating new ones from the parents context menu.</p></section><section><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Prefab Tab\" src=\"/2.9/assets/images/arrayinput-2faf9574f17ada08ef26d72bb4b1207d.png\" width=\"1954\" height=\"1474\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"editable-array-inputs\">Editable array inputs<a href=\"#editable-array-inputs\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Editable array inputs\" title=\"Direct link to Editable array inputs\">​</a></h2><p>Nodes with array type inputs can now be edited directly from the property panel.
