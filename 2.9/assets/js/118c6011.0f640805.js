Currently not all the Meta-tags provide any value with the current Noodl hosting because the website crawlers have to run javascript something that most of them skip.\\n\\nTo address this limitation, we\'re actively exploring alternative hosting solutions, such as Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR). We are planning on testing these solutions in our upcoming marketplace.\\n\\n- Enhanced notifications when workspace capacity has been exceeded, providing better visibility and awareness.\\n- Introduced a new Tag property (in Advanced HTML) on Group and Text nodes, offering additional SEO options for improved search engine optimization.\\n- Implemented extract to a component by selecting nodes and right clicking on them to open a context menu, making it possible to organize your node graphs at lightning speed!\\n- Introduced the fill method on Object, allowing users to change all properties on a Noodl Object at once.\\n- Experimental feature: Added metatags on Page nodes (Note: This feature is currently not supported by Noodl hosting).\\n- Experimental feature: Sitemap generation is now available, facilitating better navigation and searchability for SEO.\\n- Support for changing the base URL path, enabling hosting in folders, the path can be accessed via `Noodl.Env[\'BaseUrl\']`.\\n- Added partial JavaScript typings to the Query Records node.\\n- Version Control panel has a few more options when the git origin is an external git provider.\\n- The AI documentation link in Editor Settings has been updated to the latest version, ensuring access to the most recent information.\\n- Add AI Enterprise version allowing you to change the endpoint and model (requires Custom Pro plan right now).\\n- Improved collapsible section in Editor Settings, providing a more user-friendly interface.\\n- Enhanced the AI Function node with slight changes to improve functionality and performance.\\n- Enhanced the Cloud Function node function selector for improved usability.\\n- Renamed \\"Advanced Style\\" to \\"Advanced HTML\\" property group on all Visual nodes, making it more intuitive and aligned with its purpose.\\n- Emit a new event \\"NoodlApp_Navigated\\" when the Page Router navigates. Read more in the Noodl.Events API.\\n- Text Input node now has Text Alignment.\\n- Navigate and Navigate To Path nodes now has an \\"open in new tab\\" option.\\n- Added a new Controls property on the Video node allowing to show the browser video controls.\\n- Enhanced the Color input names (in node graph) of Text Input, Button, etc. Now they are \\"Icon Color\\" etc instead of just \\"Color\\".\\n- Added experimental Deploy Date and Git Stats, in the Project Settings Deploy section.
