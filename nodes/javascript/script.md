# Script

The **Script** node is used when you need to create more complex Javascript code and it provides a few more capabilities over the [Function](/nodes/javascript/function.md) node which can be used for simpler scripts. There is an extensive description of the node in the Javascript [guide](/guides/javascript.md).
