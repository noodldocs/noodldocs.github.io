# Label

The Label is used to provide text labels to controls and it has a function in accessibility where screen readers and other tools like that will make use of it. It has properties similar to the [Text](/nodes/visual/text.md) node.

It also has a **For** input that can be used to connect the **Control Id** from the associated control. Besides helping interaction this will also allow the label to be used for interacting with the control.
