Backend tasks like signing up users with external services, doing complex database lookups faster, scheduling background jobs and much more can now be done at Noodl-speed, and deployed with one click.\\n\\n</section>\\n\\n<section>\\n\\n\\n## A brand new design\\n\\nThe editor interface has gone through a face lift to increase consistency and clarity. We have also added a couple of new features that lay the groundwork for the versions to come during 2023. Most notably, the Component Canvas has been replaced with a much nicer Preview Canvas, letting you navigate your app with a new path dropdown and inspect it in different device sizes. We have also added a design mode (similar to the \u201cinspect\u201d button in previous versions) where UI elements can be selected and revealed in the Node Canvas.\\n\\n\\n</section>\\n\\n<section>\\n\\n![](./version-control.png)\\n\\n## Updated version control\\n\\nThe whole version control UX has been redesigned to be faster and easier to use, and to be able to bring you more of the power features of Git (like enhanced merging and diffing) right inside of the Noodl editor. The best low-code version control system just got even better.\\n\\n</section>\\n\\n<section>\\n\\n## More complete Javascript API\\n\\nThis release allows power users to be even more powerful by providing a more complete JavaScript API. Anything you can do with a node and connections, you can now do inside of the Function and Script nodes.\\n\\n</section>"},{"id":"november-2022-2","metadata":{"permalink":"/2.8/whats-new/november-2022-2","source":"@site/whats-new/2022-11-18.md","title":"Noodl 2.7.2 (Momofuku)","description":"Noodl 2.7.2 fixes a deploy bug reported in 2.7.1","date":"2022-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 18, 2022","tags":[],"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Noodl 2.7.2 (Momofuku)","description":"Noodl 2.7.2 fixes a deploy bug reported in 2.7.1","slug":"november-2022-2","hide_table_of_contents":true},"prevItem":{"title":"Noodl 2.8 (??)","permalink":"/2.8/whats-new/january-2023"},"nextItem":{"title":"Noodl 2.7.1 (Momofuku)","permalink":"/2.8/whats-new/november-2022"}},"content":"<section>\\n\\n## Fixes\\n- Fixed a deployement bug that caused a small amount of projects to fail to deploy\\n\\n## Changes\\n- Upgraded Electron so Noodl uses a newer version of Chromium\\n\\n</section>"},{"id":"november-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/2.8/whats-new/november-2022","source":"@site/whats-new/2022-11-08.md","title":"Noodl 2.7.1 (Momofuku)","description":"Noodl 2.7.1 fixes a few bugs reported in 2.7.0","date":"2022-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 8, 2022","tags":[],"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Noodl 2.7.1 (Momofuku)","description":"Noodl 2.7.1 fixes a few bugs reported in 2.7.0","slug":"november-2022","hide_table_of_contents":true},"prevItem":{"title":"Noodl 2.7.2 (Momofuku)","permalink":"/2.8/whats-new/november-2022-2"},"nextItem":{"title":"Noodl 2.7 (Momofuku)","permalink":"/2.8/whats-new/october-2022"}},"content":"<section>\\n\\n## Fixes\\n- Fixed regression causing deployment to take a bit longer\\n- Fixed issue with the cloud service dashboard not showing relations correctly\\n- Fixed issue with queries that included relation constraints\\n\\n</section>"},{"id":"october-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/2.8/whats-new/october-2022","source":"@site/whats-new/2022-10-25.md","title":"Noodl 2.7 (Momofuku)","description":"Noodl 2.7 introduces an important new concept that will improve your productivity called \u201cprefabs\u201d, it also has some features to help you organise projects better and a few general improvements.","date":"2022-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 25, 2022","tags":[],"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Noodl 2.7 (Momofuku)","description":"Noodl 2.7 introduces an important new concept that will improve your productivity called \u201cprefabs\u201d, it also has some features to help you organise projects better and a few general improvements.","slug":"october-2022","hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Noodl 2.7.1 (Momofuku)","permalink":"/2.8/whats-new/november-2022"},"nextItem":{"title":"September update","permalink":"/2.8/whats-new/september-2022"}},"content":"<section>\\n\\n![Prefab Tab](./prefabs.png)\\n## Prefabs\\n\\nA new concept is introduced called Prefabs, it is pre-fabricated components, made from Noodl core nodes, that you can easily clone into your project as a starting point for building a wide range of user interfaces.
