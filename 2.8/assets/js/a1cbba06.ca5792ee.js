This opens up a host of new possibilities that previously required either using an external service like Zapier or writing code, and honestly why would you ever want to leave the comfort of Noodl.\\n</section>\\n\\n<section>\\n\\n\\n## A brand new design\\n\\nIn 2.8 the editor interface has gone through a re-design to increase consistency and clarity. But most notable the visual component canvas has been replaced with a much nicer preview and the ability to choose which page is currently shown as well as a design mode where UI elements can be selected and revealed in the editor.\\n\\n</section>\\n\\n<section>\\n\\n![](./version-control.png)\\n\\n## Updated version control\\n\\nWe have a redesigned beautiful new version control system bringing in more of the power features of git to the Noodl environment, with for instance enhanced merging and diffing.\\n\\n</section>\\n\\n<section>\\n\\n## More complete Javascript API\\n\\nThis release also provides a more complete Javascript API where now anything you can do with a node and connections you can also do with the API (in function and script nodes) for those of you that feel comfortable whipping out your coding skills, go nuts!\\n\\n</section>"},{"id":"november-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/2.8/whats-new/november-2022","source":"@site/whats-new/2022-11-08.md","title":"Noodl 2.7.1 (Momofuku)","description":"Noodl 2.7.1 fixes a few bugs reported in 2.7.0","date":"2022-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 8, 2022","tags":[],"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Noodl 2.7.1 (Momofuku)","description":"Noodl 2.7.1 fixes a few bugs reported in 2.7.0","slug":"november-2022","hide_table_of_contents":true},"prevItem":{"title":"Noodl 2.8 (??)","permalink":"/2.8/whats-new/january-2023"},"nextItem":{"title":"Noodl 2.7 (Momofuku)","permalink":"/2.8/whats-new/october-2022"}},"content":"<section>\\n\\n## Fixes\\n- Fixed regression causing deployment to take a bit longer\\n- Fixed issue with the cloud service dashboard not showing relations correctly\\n- Fixed issue with queries that included relation constraints\\n\\n</section>"},{"id":"october-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/2.8/whats-new/october-2022","source":"@site/whats-new/2022-10-25.md","title":"Noodl 2.7 (Momofuku)","description":"Noodl 2.7 introduces an important new concept that will improve your productivity called \u201cprefabs\u201d, it also has some features to help you organise projects better and a few general improvements.","date":"2022-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 25, 2022","tags":[],"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Noodl 2.7 (Momofuku)","description":"Noodl 2.7 introduces an important new concept that will improve your productivity called \u201cprefabs\u201d, it also has some features to help you organise projects better and a few general improvements.","slug":"october-2022","hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Noodl 2.7.1 (Momofuku)","permalink":"/2.8/whats-new/november-2022"},"nextItem":{"title":"September update","permalink":"/2.8/whats-new/september-2022"}},"content":"<section>\\n\\n![Prefab Tab](./prefabs.png)\\n## Prefabs\\n\\nA new concept is introduced called Prefabs, it is pre-fabricated components, made from Noodl core nodes, that you can easily clone into your project as a starting point for building a wide range of user interfaces. You can also find guides helping you to take these prefabs and customize them to suit your own specific needs.\\n</section>\\n\\n<section>\\n\\n\\n![Prefab Tab](./nestedcomponents.png)\\n\\n## Sub components\\n\\nTo make it easier to organize your project, work with Prefabs, and to create custom components we have enabled the possibility to move components into other components just like folders. This can make components that are dependent on other components to function move self-sustainable. \\n\\nFolder component children can be created just like components in folders - by dragging in to, or creating new ones from the parents context menu.\\n\\n</section>\\n\\n<section>\\n\\n![Prefab Tab](./arrayinput.png)\\n\\n## Editable array inputs\\n\\nNodes with array type inputs can now be edited directly from the property panel.
