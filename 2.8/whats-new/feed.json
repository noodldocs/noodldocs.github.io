We have also added a couple of new features that lay the groundwork for the versions to come during 2023. Most notably, the Component Canvas has been replaced with a much nicer Preview Canvas, letting you navigate your app with a new path dropdown and inspect it in different device sizes. We have also added a design mode (similar to the “inspect” button in previous versions) where UI elements can be selected and revealed in the Node Canvas.</p></section><section><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/2.8/assets/images/version-control-22bd6c5d437619286604509faf3de57b.png\" width=\"2591\" height=\"1091\" class=\"img_E7b_\"></p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV\" id=\"updated-version-control\">Updated version control<a class=\"hash-link\" href=\"#updated-version-control\" title=\"Direct link to heading\">​</a></h2><p>The whole version control UX has been redesigned to be faster and easier to use, and to be able to bring you more of the power features of Git (like enhanced merging and diffing) right inside of the Noodl editor.
