**Position**  
Controls how this node is layouted in its parent group.

- _In Layout_ - This node is part of the parent group layout, it will be stacked with its siblings depending on the parent group layout settings.
- _Absolute_ - This node will not be part of the parent group layout, instead you are free to use the _Pos X_ and _Pos Y_ to place this node explicitly.
- _Sticky_ - Behaves like _In Layout_, except when the node is about the be scrolled outside the parent. It'll stick to an edge of the parent instead of scrolling away. Which edge can be controlled with the **Alignment** input.
