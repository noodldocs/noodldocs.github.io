# Component Stack
The **Component Stack** node is used to navigate between components in an area on the screen. It is typically used together with the navigation nodes [Push Component](/nodes/component-stack/push-component/) and [Pop Component](/nodes/component-stack/pop-component).

Unlike the somewhat similar [Page Router](/nodes/navigation/page-router/) the **Component Stack** is optimized for app type navigation (in contrast to web type) and does not use URLs and routing as part of the navigation.
