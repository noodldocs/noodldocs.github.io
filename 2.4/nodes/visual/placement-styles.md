**Pos X**  
The X position of the node. Either relative to its parent top left corner or relative to its layouted position depending on the _Position_ property. Can be specified in pixels or as a percentage of its parent's width.

**Pos Y**  
The Y position of the node either relative to its parent's top left corner or relative to its layouted position depending on the _Position_ property. Can be specified in pixels or as a percentage of its parent's height.

**Rotation**  
The rotation in degrees.

**Scale**  
Specifies scaling of this node. A value of 0 scales the node down completely so that it is no longer be visible. A value of 1 gives it the original size, and a value of 2 doubles the size and so on.

**Transform Origin X**  
Specifes the X position, within this node, that will be the center for rotation and scale. By default it is the center of the node (i.e. 50%) but you can specify an arbitrary value in either percentage of the node's width or explicitly in pixels.

**Transform Origin Y**  
Specifes the Y position, within this node, that will be the center for rotation and scale. By default it is the center of the node (i.e. 50%) but you can specify an arbitrary value in either percentage of the node's height or explicitly in pixels.
