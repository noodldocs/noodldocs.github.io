# Script

This node allows you to add complex JavaScript to your application. Please refer to the [Script Guide](/guides/javascript.md) to learn more about the API. But remember - with great power comes great responsibility.

<div class="ndl-image-with-background l">

</div>

In most cases you are better off using the simpler <span class="ndl-node">[Function](/nodes/javascript/function/)</span> node for your custom JavaScript.
