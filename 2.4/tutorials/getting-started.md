# Build your first app

Here you will find a video series showing how to build a Task List app. It will take around half an hour to watch all of the (two) videos and at the end you will have built a fully functional app, connected to a database and cloud services.

If you are new to node based programming, or want to learn more about the editor, you may look through the [Basic Concepts](guides/basic-concepts/) guide or the [Editor Tour](/guides/editor-tour/), but it is **not** a requirement to follow along in the Task List videos below.
