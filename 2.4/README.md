# Happy to see you here!

Noodl is a node based app builder. Itâ€™s a way of visually building an application in a way that is similar to code but without any coding skills necessary. The main focus is to empower designers and developers and provide a workflow that allows for high flexibility, scalability and quick iterations.

## Getting started

-   If you're **new to node based programming**, it is recommended to at least glance through the [Basic Concepts](/guides/basic-concepts/) page to get an overview of the essentials.

-   If you just want to **get more familiar** with the editor you can watch the [Editor Tour](/guides/editor-tour/), a 15 minute long video taking you through the tool.

-   If you want to **get your hands dirty** straight away we recommend the [Build your first app](/guides/getting-started), two 15 minute long videos taking you through the process of building out a UI for task list app and connecting it to a cloud database.

## Extending Noodl

Although most apps can be built with the included nodes, Noodl can [easily be extended](/extending/README) with custom code, opening up new possibilites for collaboration between UX/UI designers and developers.
