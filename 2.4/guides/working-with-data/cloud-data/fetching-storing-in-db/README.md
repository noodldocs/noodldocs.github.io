# Storing and fetching data in a database

## What you will learn in this guide
In this guide you will learn how to store data in a cloud database using the different **Record** nodes such as [Record](/nodes/data/cloud-data/record/), [Create New Record](/nodes/data/cloud-data/create-new-record/) and [Set Record Properties](/nodes/data/cloud-data/set-record-properties/). 


## Overview

We will go through the following steps in this guide:

* Create a **Record** in the database
* Modify properties of the **Record**
* Delete a **Record** in the database
* Query **Records** in the database

Before starting this guide, make sure you have Cloud Services enabled and have at least one **Class** in the database. You can learn how to do this in [this](/guides/working-with-data/cloud-data/creating-backend/) and [this](/guides/working-with-data/cloud-data/creating-class/) guide.
