# Updating Records in the Database

## What you will learn in this guide

In this guide you will learn how to use the [Set Record Properties](/nodes/data/cloud-data/set-record-properties/) node to update data in the Database. 

## Overview

We will go through the following steps in this guide

* Update previously queried **Records**

To get most out of this guide, it's best that you are already familiar with how to set up a cloud backend, create **Classes** and **Records** and query them. You can quickly learn that by going through the following guides:

* [Creating a Backend](/guides/working-with-data/cloud-data/creating-backend/)
* [Creating a Class](/guides/working-with-data/cloud-data/creating-class/)
* [Creating Records](/guides/working-with-data/cloud-data/creating-records/)
* [Query Records](/guides/working-with-data/cloud-data/querying-records/)

## Updating Records in the database

It's simple to update **Records** in the database using the [Set Record Properties](/nodes/data/cloud-data/set-record-properties/) node. You basically make sure the **Id** is set to the right **Record**, set the properties to what you want them to be and signal the **Do** input.

To try it out, make sure you have a backend enabled for your project. Set up a **Class** in the Database with some **Records** in. Finally Query some items from the **Database**. If you follow the previous "Working With Cloud Data" guides you can use the simple Task list created there. It looks something like this:

<div class="ndl-image-with-background">

![](../querying-records/items-2.png)

</div>

The app has two components, the main component called "App" and a List Item called "Task Item".

The main component that looks like this:

<div class="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](orig-app.png)

</div>

And the list item like this

<div class="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](../querying-records/record-3.png)

</div>

A clear shortcoming of this small app is that when you complete a task and check its checkbox the database wont actually update. The `isDone` property will not change.

You can double check that by clicking a few items and reload the app. The changes are only visual, the underlying data is not changed.

</div>

### The Set Record Properties node
To update a **Record** you use the [Set Record Properties](/nodes/data/cloud-data/set-record-properties/) node.

Add the node to your List Item. Click it and make sure it points to the correct **Class**.

<div class="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](list-item-1.png)

</div>


<div class="ndl-image-with-background">

![](set-record-prop-1.png)

</div>

Also note the option `Store to`. You can chose to store changes either locally and in the cloud, or only locally. Let it be set to `Cloud and locally` as we our changes to be stored directly in the database.

Sometimes it makes sense to only store the changes locally at first. For example, if you have a form with multiple fields and a "Save" button, it might make sense to first store only locally and when the user presses "Save" to store all changes at once.

Now we need to make sure the **Id** of the **Set Record Properties** are set correctly to the **Id** that the **Repeater** provides.

<div class="ndl-image-with-background">

![](set-record-prop-2.png)

</div>

Now the only two things left to do is to connect the **Checkbox** to the `isDone` property and trigger the **Do** signal of the **Set Record Properties**. We want to save whenever the state of the **Checkbox** is updated, so lets connect the **Changed** signal coming out of the **Checkbox** to **Do**.

<div class="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](list-item-2.png)

</div>

We're done! Click on your different tasks and double check that they are correctly saved by bringing up your **Dashboard** inspect the `isDone` properties. Don't forget to press  `Refresh` in the **Dashboard** to update the view.
