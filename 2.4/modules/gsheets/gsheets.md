# Google Sheets Module

The Google Sheets Module makes it easy to read data from publich Google Sheets. Use it for example to use Google Sheets as a CMS system or a read-only data repository. There are three nodes included, [Query Sheet](/modules/gsheet/node-docs/query-sheet/), [Query Sheet Aggregate](/modules/gsheet/node-docs/query-sheet-aggregate/) and [Sheet Row](/modules/gsheet/node-docs/sheet-row/).

?> Note that the Google Sheet need to be made publicly available for the module to be able to access it. Also, the module is read-only, i.e. you cannot write data to the Google Sheet.
