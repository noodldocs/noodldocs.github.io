# Material UI Icons

## Adding the module to your project

Since the **Icon | Material UI** node is not part of the default node set in Noodl, we need to add the Material UI Icons module. Open the Noodl project in which you want to add the module, and import it from the sidebar.

<div class="ndl-images">
    <img src="/modules/mui-icons/mui-add-module.png" class="ndl-image med"></img>
</div>

Once that's done you'll be able to create the **Icon | Material UI** node.

After you have added the module to your project you will have access to the [Material UI Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline) by placing the **Icon | Material UI** node.

On the properties of this node you can specify which icon to use (you can find the name of the icon using the link above), as well as styling and color.
