# Cloud Project Migration

In Noodl 2.3, new cloud projects will use an improved system that is more stable, secure and will allow us to support features in the future such as branching etc. The new cloud projects are using the popular version control [Git](https://git-scm.com/) which also makes easier to integrate into your development process.

When creating a new cloud project in 2.3 you will automatically get the new type, but any existing cloud projects still use the old system. This will continue to work fine but will not receive updates and bugfixes as prombly so we recommend migrating to a new cloud project (which will also have a bunch of fancy new version control features). 

To migrate an old project you need to create a new **Cloud Project** just as you normally do. Then you find your old project in the **Library** panel.

You can search for the name of your project. When you find it, hit **Import** to show the import popup.

Make sure you select everything, all components and files, from the import popup and then hit the **Import** button.

That's it, now you can start using all of the neat new version control features. You will find them in the **Version control panel** in the toolbar to the left. And you can learn more about how to work with version control in the [guide](guides/version-control/).
